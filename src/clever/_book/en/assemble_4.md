## Installing motors

1. Unbox the motors.
2. Shorten the motor wires using wire strippers or sidecutters:

    * Cut wires to 30 mm.
    * Strip 5 mm of insulation while taking care to not damage the cores

    <img src="../assets/4/04.png" width=300 class="zoom center border">

    * Twist the cores.
    * [Tin the wires](tinning.md). You may want to use tweezers to hold the wire.

3. Place the motor on the support arm.
4. Use hexagonal M3x5 screws to attach the motor to its arm.

Perform these actions for each motor.

## Frame assembly

1. Install the support arms on the frame base according to their rotation direction. Use notches as guides.

    > **Hint** Note the motor nut colors when installing the arms. Motors with red nuts should be placed on the front right and back left arms, with black ones - on the front left and back right arms.

2. Attach the arms to the frame base using 8 M3x8 screws, 6 steel nuts, and 2 15 mm spacers.

## Preparing the power distribution board

1. [Tin](tinning.md) the pads on the power distribution board.
2. Check the board for shorts using a multimeter:
    * Set your multimeter to the Continuity Test mode.
    * Ensure your multimeter works by connecting the probes to each other. The multimeter should beep.
    * Connect one of the probes to the **«+»** pad and the other to **«-»/GND**. If there is a short circuit, the multimeter will beep.

## Mounting the PDB

1. Attach four 6 mm standoffs on the top carbon deck using M3x6 screws.

4. Check the board for shorts using a multimeter.

## Checking motor rotation direction

Motors with **<font color=red>red</font>** nuts should rotate **counterclockwise**, the ones with **black** nuts should rotate **clockwise**. Correct rotation direction should also be printed on the motors. You can use a servo tester or your RC transmitter and receiver to check rotation direction.

The following describes how to use your RC gear to check the motor direction.

### Setting up PWM mode on RC

Turn on your transmitter using the **POWER** slider. If the RC transmitter is locked, place all controls in their neutral position:

1. Left stick should be in the **lower center position**.
2. Right stick should be **centered**.
3. The switches (A, B, C, D) should be in the **top position**.

    <img src="../assets/4/radio/base.png" alt="Neutral control state" width=500 class="zoom center">

Make sure the transmitter operates in the PWM mode:

1. Power down the receiver.
2. Hold down the "OK" button to enter the menu.
3. Select the "System setup" option, press "OK" to enter the submenu.
4. Select "RX Setup" option.
5. Select "Output mode".
6. Make sure the "PWM" option is selected.
7. Save settings by holding the "Cancel" button.

### Binding the RC transmitter and receiver

1. Turn off the RC transmitter with the **POWER** slider.
2. Connect the RC receiver to the 5 V BEC output. Connect the black wire into one of the bottom pins and the red wire to one of the central pins.
3. Place the binding jumper on the B/VCC output.
4. Connect the battery pack.
5. The LED on the RC receiver should start to blink.

        <img src="../assets/4/13_1.png" width=300 class="zoom border">
    </div>

6. Hold down the **BIND KEY** on the RC transmitter.
7. Turn on the RC transmitter while holding the **BIND KEY**

    <img src="../assets/4/radio/binding.png" width=500 class="zoom center">

8. Wait for the **RXBind ok** message on the RC transmitter
9. Disconnect the binding jumper.
10. The LED on the RC receiver should be lit continuously.

### Checking the motor rotation direction

1. Disconnect the battery pack and power down the transmitter.
2. Connect the signal wires from the ESC to CH3 pins on the output. The white wire should go to the top pin, the black one should go to the bottom one.
3. Power on the transmitter. Make sure the left stick is in the bottom position.
4. Connect the battery pack.
5. Slowly move the left stick up until the motor starts to spin.

If the motor rotation direction is wrong, switch any two motor wires.

> **Info** You can also change motor direction by reprogramming the speed controllers. The process is described [in the ESC firmware flashing article](esc_firmware.md).

Do this for each motor.

### Switching the transmitter back to PPM mode

The flight controller expects PPM signal from your RC gear. Switch your transmitter back to PPM before flight.

1. Make sure the receiver is not powered.
2. Hold down the "OK" button to enter the menu.
3. Select the "System setup" option, press "OK" to enter the submenu.
4. Select "RX Setup" option.
5. Select "Output mode".
6. Make sure the "PPM" option is selected.
7. Save settings by holding the "Cancel" button.
